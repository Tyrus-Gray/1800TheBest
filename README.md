(Working on Name) Designing Keyboard with Every Possible Creature Comfort

I've been looking around, I've been looking down for a keyboard with every feature that I could want. 
I just have so many different things that I think would be cool to have. 
I dont want to spend $100 on a keyboard that does not make me smile when I use it.
